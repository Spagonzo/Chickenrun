A game of chance where the stakes are ever higher. 

  Player(s) face off against a Computer user in a game of chance. Each game consists of 5 rounds, and the highest score at the end of 5 rounds wins the game. Each round every player "rolls" a 6 sided die. If the player rolls a 1, then the round is over and the player receives a 0 score for that round. Otherwise, multiply the player's current score by the dice roll. The round ends when all players have finished their dice rolls.
